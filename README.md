## About the app
This app is based around lawn and garden maintenance.  The app serves two main purposes;  making it easy to get landscape work done and being able to better customize what days the maintenance is carried out.

Scheduled Maintenance will open to a scheduling page where a user can see upcoming maintenance and/or the availability of a crew to come additional days.  I plan to have a customized calendar showing this for the user to see once they have logged into the page.  Specialized Maintenance will include options to select such as flower planting, mulching and seasonal services like winterizing.  Landscape Design will be a form for the client to fill out with some options to select and/or a brief description of the design they are looking for. 

## User Stories:

### Admin:
As a landscape maintenance company I would like to decrease the amount of man hours spent on scheduling and new sign-ups by using a webpage so that I can decrease labour cost.

### Customers:
As a homeowner, I want to easily book lawn maintenance by using a webpage to choose the maintenance options I want along with what days do and donâ€™t work. 

As a business or commercial rental company, I want to easily get a rough estimate and get in contact to schedule non regular maintenance like fresh sodding and mulching in garden beds after the spring melt.

As a property manager i want to schedule maintenance crews more or less often depending on what is needed for the property so that i don't have unnecessary maintenance.
