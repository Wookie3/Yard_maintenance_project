As a landscape maintenance company I would like to decrease the amount of man hours spent on scheduling and new sign-ups by using a webpage so that I can decrease labour cost.

Customer:
As a homeowner, I want to easily book lawn maintenance by using a webpage to choose the maintenance options I want along with what days do and donâ€™t work. 

As a business or commercial rental company, I want to easily get a rough estimate and get in contact to schedule non regular maintenance like fresh sodding and mulching in garden beds after the spring melt.

As a property manager i want to schedule maintenance crews more or less often depending on what is needed for the property so that i don't have unnecessary maintenance.
