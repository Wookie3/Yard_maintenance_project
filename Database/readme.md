### Files 
First file "YardKeeperDB.sql" is to create the database and populate it with some simple sample data.
Second file "db_scripts.sql" contains all the scripts for using the database as well as the select statements.

## Description

This database is meant to facilitate the day to day operations of a landscape service business.

I originally wanted to pursue the scheduling side of this application as well as day-to-day operations of a landscape company. 
I decided to focus only on the company operations and landscape tasks instead.

The database I have built is around having work tasks that are to be completed by the company staff. 
Some of the included views would be examples of what a company staff would need to view.
There are script examples for all the day-to-day operations that would happen.
